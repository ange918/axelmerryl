# Axel Merryl Artist Portfolio

## Overview

This is a modern, visually striking portfolio website for French artist Axel Merryl, focusing on music and humor content. The site features a dark, cinematic design with gold accents, full-width hero sections, and smooth scroll animations. Built with vanilla JavaScript and static HTML, it emphasizes visual storytelling through images, videos, and dynamic content sections.

The project creates an immersive experience with parallax effects, fade-in animations, and comprehensive mobile responsive design. Key sections include a hero landing, biography, music/clips gallery, testimonials slider, visual gallery with descriptive captions, upcoming events, and footer with social links.

## Recent Changes (October 2025)

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Technology Stack:**
- Pure HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)
- Static HTML files with integrated headers/footers
- Python HTTP server for local development
- Custom CSS with CSS variables for theming
- Montserrat and Playfair Display font families

**Design System:**
- CSS custom properties (`:root` variables) for consistent theming
- Dark color palette (black #0a0a0a, anthracite #1a1a1a) with bright accents (gold #d4af37, yellow #f4d03f, warm white #f5f5dc)
- Smooth transitions using cubic-bezier easing: `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)`
- Responsive container system with max-width constraints (1200px)

**Layout Strategy:**
- Full-viewport hero section (100vh) with absolute positioning for background images
- Section-based vertical scroll structure with distinct visual separations
- Two container types: `.container` (max-width 1200px) and `.container-full` (full width with padding)
- Flexbox for centering and alignment

**Animation & Interaction Patterns:**
- Intersection Observer API for scroll-triggered fade-in animations (threshold: 0.1, rootMargin: -100px)
- Parallax scrolling effect (50% scroll speed) on background elements
- Smooth scroll behavior for anchor links
- Lazy class addition pattern (`.visible` class added when elements enter viewport)
- Auto-sliding testimonials with 5-second interval

**Responsive Design:**
- Mobile-first approach with 768px breakpoint
- Significantly reduced text sizes on mobile:
  - Hero title: 2.5rem → 1.8rem
  - Hero subtitle: 1.2rem → 0.9rem
  - Section titles: 3rem → 1.8rem
  - Body text: proportionally scaled
  - Buttons: 1.2rem → 1rem
- CSS reset with box-sizing: border-box
- Overflow-x hidden to prevent horizontal scroll issues
- Flexible padding using rem units
- Hamburger menu with smooth animation on mobile

### Component Structure

**Implemented Sections:**
1. **Hero Section** - Full-screen visual with overlay, title "AXEL MERRYL", subtitle "HUMOUR & MUSIQUE", and single "DÉCOUVREZ-MOI" CTA button

3. **Music/Clips Section** - Grid-based gallery (4 albums) with hover effects and play icons
4. **Gallery Section** - 6-card image gallery with descriptive captions on hover:
   - "Sur scène lors d'un spectacle d'humour"
   - "Moment de concentration avant le show"
   - "Interaction avec le public"
   - "Performance live au festival"
   - "Session d'enregistrement en studio"
   - "Répétitions musicales"

- Hover states with subtle zoom/overlay transitions on gallery cards
- Gallery caption overlays with smooth transitions
- Testimonial auto-rotation with manual navigation
- Smooth section transitions
- Lightbox functionality for gallery images
- Mobile burger menu with hamburger-to-X animation

### JavaScript Architecture

**Core Patterns:**
- Event-driven architecture using `DOMContentLoaded` initialization
- Observer pattern for scroll animations (IntersectionObserver)
- Event delegation for smooth scrolling links
- Passive scroll listening for parallax effects
- Interval-based testimonial rotation (5000ms)

**Features Implemented:**
- Burger menu toggle with class-based animation
- Smooth scroll to sections
- Parallax hero background
- Fade-in animations on scroll
- Gallery lightbox with keyboard navigation (arrow keys, escape)
- Testimonial slider with auto-advance and manual controls
- Null safety checks for elements that may not exist on all pages

**Performance Optimizations:**
- Single scroll event listener with minimal DOM queries
- Intersection Observer to avoid constant scroll calculations
- Class-based animation triggering (GPU-accelerated CSS transitions)
- Debouncing approach via rootMargin offset
- Conditional event listener attachment (null checks)

**Code Organization:**
- Single-file approach for simplicity (js/script.js)
- Modular sections within main initialization function
- Reusable observer for multiple fade-in elements
- Selector-based targeting for extensibility
